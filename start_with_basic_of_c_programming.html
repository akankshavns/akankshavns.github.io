        <p>
            <span>Hello!</span>visitor my self Akanksha Mishra .Here in this web page I am introdusing you some
            programing language like C,C++,C#,python and java and also here we learn about HTML,CSS and javascript for
            web development.
        </p>
        <p><span>Akanksham</span> is a learnig platform where I am gives some ideas about C programing language</p>

                <h3>Need of programing</h3>
                <p>For making a software we need a programing language because software is a collection of programing
                    language. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Programing Language </h3>
                <p>A programing is a set of instruction which is given by user or a programer according to its
                    requirements.There are two types of programing languages.

                    <li>High-level programing language</li>
                    <li>Low-level programing language</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>High-level programing language</h5>
                <p>High-level languages are designed keeping in mind the features of portability i.e. these languages
                    are
                    machine independent. These are English like languages, so it is easy to write and understand the
                    programs
                    of high-level language.For translating a high-level language program into machine language, compiler
                    or interpreter is
                    used. Every language has its own compiler or interpreter. Some languages in this category
                    are-Python,Java,C,C++ and C# etc.</p>

                <h5>Low-level programing language</h5>
                <p>The languages in this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Machine Language :-</h5>
                        <p>The machine language consists of instructions that are in binary 0 or 1. Computers can
                            understand only machine level language.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Assembly Language :-</h5>
                        <p>The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a
                            modified form of machine level language called assembly language. In assembly language
                            instructions are given in English like words, such as MOV, ADD, SUB etc. So it is easier to
                            write and understand assembly programs</p>
